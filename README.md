# One Piece Poster Shop

Welcome to the One Piece Poster Shop! This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using React, Strapi, and Stripe. It allows users to browse and purchase posters featuring characters from the One Piece anime and manga series.

The frontend of the app is built using React and makes use of functional components and Hooks. The backend is powered by Strapi, a headless content management system (CMS) built on top of Node.js. Strapi provides a set of APIs and a user interface for managing and organizing the app's content, as well as handling authentication and authorization.

We use Stripe for secure and convenient online payments. All orders are processed and shipped within 1-2 business days.

If you're interested in building a similar app, you can use the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Strapi: A headless CMS for building APIs and a backend for your web application
- Stripe: A payment platform for handling online transactions

To get started building your own app, you can follow the documentation for each of these technologies and look for online tutorials and example projects.

Thank you for visiting our store, and we hope you find the perfect poster to add to your collection!
